I wanted to claim that this is the "world's first 1D4B fighting game"; however, I just did a google search and found that someone else has already created a 1-D fighting game:

That game is pretty cool and is very similar to what I had in mind. Hopefully I can make something innovative even though Colin Lu, Jon Schneider, and Anderson Wang beat me to this simplified game design!
